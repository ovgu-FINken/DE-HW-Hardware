*                             WARNING                                          *
********************************************************************************
Due to signal name changes in the schematics of this library it is intended for 
new projects only. Updateing existing EAGLE projects using earlier versions of 
this library may change the schematic. Keep in mind that you have to check 
and/or change your schematic parts and signals after library update!
